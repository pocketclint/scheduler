# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
A daily planning tool that covers a standard 9-5 work day. Based on the hour of the day being accessed, the hour boxes will be colored to correlate to the past/present/future--grey boxes representing the past, red refers to the current hour, and green for the remainder of the day to come.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
WHEN I open the planner  
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  
WHEN I scroll down  
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours  
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  
WHEN I click into a time block  
THEN I can enter an event  
WHEN I click the save button for that time block  
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN the saved events persist  

## Usage
The user can input whatever needs to occur between the hours of 9AM-5PM--"meeting with John," "lunch with Sara," etc. The user can save this input using the blue save button, which records the information to local storage. When the user leaves the page, the information is retained.
